### RetroLegends

A celebration of classic computing history through authentic phosphor display colors. Each color pays homage to iconic machines: VT100's P1 phosphor green, Wyse 60's P3 amber, Commodore 64's vibrant red, IBM 3278's corporate blue, and more. Perfect for developers who appreciate computing history.

Check out my matching [Oh My Posh theme](https://github.com/veteranbv/Retro_Legends_Transient_OMP_theme) if you use Oh My Posh. I created it to bring the same classic computing aesthetic to the command prompt, with modern features like transient prompts and development environment indicators.
